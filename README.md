# Object Tracking and Path Plotting for VR Glasses

## Overview
This code is designed for VR glasses with integrated sensors that provide real-time coordinates of a human object. The device is securely attached to a specific part of the user's body. The primary purpose of this code is to enable accurate tracking and path plotting of the object's movement.

## Features
+ Real-Time Object Tracking: The code utilizes the sensors embedded in the VR glasses to continuously monitor and update the position of the attached object in real-time.

+ Path Plotting: It allows you to visualize the trajectory or path taken by the object over time, providing valuable insights into the user's movements in a VR environment.

## Usage
* Device Setup: Ensure that the VR glasses and the tracking device are correctly set up and connected to the system.

* Code Integration: Integrate this code into your VR application or project to enable object tracking.

* Data Visualization: Utilize the path plotting functionality to visualize the object's movements and interactions within the VR environment.
